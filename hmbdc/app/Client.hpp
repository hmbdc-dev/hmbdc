 * @class Client<>
 * @brief A Client represents a thread of execution/a task. The execution is managed by

 * a Client object could participate in message dispatching as the receiver of specifed 
 * message types
 * @details message is dispatched thru callbacks in the loose 
 * form of void handleMessageCb(Message const& m) or void handleMessageCb(Message& m).
 * some callbacks have default implementations.
 * however, all callbacks are overridable to provide desired effects;
 * When running in a Context, all callbacks (*Cb methods) for a hmbdc Client instance 
 * are garanteed to be called from a single OS thread, ie. no 2 callabacks of an Client 
 * instance are called concurrently, so the Client programmer can assume a 
 * single thread programming model callback-wise. 
 * The above also holds true for timer firing callbacks when a concrete Client deriving 
 * from TimerManager that manages the timers
 * 
 * See in example hmbdc.cpp @snippet hmbdc.cpp write a Client
 * 
 * @tparam CcClient the concrete Client type
 * @tparam typename ... Messages message types that the Client interested
 * if the type of JustBytes is declared, use a special callback see below
